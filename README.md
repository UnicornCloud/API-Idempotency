A Key principle in All our Code! |

Inspire: [PayPal ยง API Idempotency](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api-basics/#api-idempotency)

'''API idempotency
You can make idempotent calls any number of times without concern that the server creates or completes an action on a resource more than once. You can retry idempotent calls that fail with network timeouts or HTTP 5xx status codes for as long as the server stores the ID. Idempotency enables you to correlate request payloads with response payloads, eliminate duplicate requests, and retry failed requests or requests with unclear responses.'''
